# 🚖 Uber Rides Analytics Dashboard  

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics** using PostgreSQL, Power BI, and Scrum (Jira).  
It includes database modeling, SQL views, interactive dashboards, and Agile project tracking.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Project Management**: Jira (Scrum demo board)  

---

## 📊 Features  

- **Data Modeling**  
  - PostgreSQL schema with tables for customers, drivers, rides, and cancellation reasons.  
  - SQL views for aggregated insights.  

- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  - Successful rides summary (total rides, revenue, trends).  
  - Unsuccessful rides summary (driver cancellations, customer cancellations, incomplete rides).  
  - Cancellation slicers to filter by reason with dynamic counts.  
  - Date filters to analyze performance by time.  

- **Agile/Scrum Demo**  
  - Created sample epics, stories, and tasks in Jira.  
  - Illustrated how analytics work can be tracked using Scrum methodology.
