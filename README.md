# üöñ Uber Rides Analytics Dashboard  

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end data analytics pipeline. It transforms raw Uber ride data into actionable business insights by leveraging a normalized PostgreSQL database, advanced SQL views, and an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project workflow is managed using Agile/Scrum principles in Jira.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Project Management**: Jira (Scrum demo board)


## üî¨ Project Architecture & Data Flow

The project follows a structured data pipeline to ensure scalability and maintainability:

**Raw Data (CSV)** ‚Üí **PostgreSQL Database** ‚Üí **SQL Analytical View** ‚Üí **Power BI Dashboard**

This architecture separates raw data storage from the analytical layer, allowing for efficient querying and simplified dashboard development in Power BI.


## üìÑ Database Schema Design

To optimize for data integrity and reduce redundancy, the original flat dataset was normalized into a relational schema with two primary tables. This design improves scalability and simplifies data management.

`rides` Table
- Stores the core transactional details for each ride. `booking_id` is the Primary Key.

| Column Name                     | Data Type       | Description                                                                 |
